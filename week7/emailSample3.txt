Hello Alison,

Hope this email finds you in good health and cheer. I have read the documentation of the B1/B2 extension application. I have to fill and file I-539 form. If I didn't get the extension, I have to immediately leave the country. But I am ready to take a chance and I sincerely hope I get the extension. Now, coming to the extension, I am not sure if I would be getting a 6 month extension or an extension until the end of the program. 
In the required documentation for the filing, I have to pay a filing fee of $290, a return flight ticket back to India should be provided, and a couple of other documents like I-90, passport which I already have need to be submitted. 
I have a return ticket which is non-refundable for July 15th which I purchased before entering the country. Currently, I am a lot short on money to purchase a ticket immediately for the filing. The ticket is about $900 for the dates in the week after the program i.e., Aug 8th to Aug 13th. Could I get help for the flight expenses from the FDL as I will not anyways be receiving any stipend and also for the filing fees? 

I wanted to discuss with you first regarding this matter, hence I am emailing you beforehand because of the email from Jordan today (quoted at the end of this email). I don't know if I can ask Jordan directly regarding the payment for flight ticket and I felt wrong asking him without consulting you. 

Thank you and looking forward to your reply.

Yours sincerely,
Srav
